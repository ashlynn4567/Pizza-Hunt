## Description

This is my eleventh project for the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp 2022. In this project, I was given the front-end of a website and a set of requirements to create the back-end api and database. I used MongoDB and Mongoose.js to create a social media recipe app where users can post their creative spins on pizza, add comments to recipes, and create threads within comments.

## Deployed Site

Follow [this link](https://intense-retreat-40554.herokuapp.com/) to view and use our site!

## Features

This is how the front-end webpage appears to viewers. It is responsive, adapting to multiple screen sizes. The homepage shows all of the pizzas that users have posted to the site, showing in order from newest to oldest. If users click the "Create a New Pizza" button on the right hand side. They are then brought to a page hosting a form. Users can fill out this form to create their own pizza recipe and post it to the site.

## Installation

In order to use this application, you will need to install it on your local computer.

1. Open the command line interface.
2. Clone the repository onto your local machine using the `git clone` command.
3. Once the repository has been cloned, navigate into the root directory of the application using the command `cd Pizza-Hunt`.
4. Run the command `npm install` to install necessary packages and dependencies.
5. Once the dependencies have been properly installed, enter the command `npm start` to initiate the application and start the connection to the database.

For further help with installation, please refer to the below demonstration video.
